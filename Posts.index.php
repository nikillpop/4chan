                Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. 
                Separated they live in <a href="#">Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics</a>, a large language ocean. 
                A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. 
                It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

                Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life.
                One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
